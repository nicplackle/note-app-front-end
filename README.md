# Note App Front End

## The Mission

Use the **Note App API** you created in the previous exercise and create the front end for it. For this choose between _React, Angular and Vue.js_.

## Sprint 0

Make an overview of the different front end frameworks on the market and sum up the pros and cons of each one.

### React

#### Pros

- Developped by Facebook
- Can be dropped into existing web app/view
- Can make mobile apps with React Native
- Most popular as it is used by lots of large companies

#### Cons

- Regular updates are necessary to keep your apps up-to-date
- Not actually a framework but a library of components

![Angular](https://github.com/nicplackle/note-app-front-end/img/angular_logo.png "Angular")

### Angular

#### Pros

- Developped by Google
- It is a framework, not just a library
- Good for building big apps
- Can be used to build mobile apps with Iconic or NativeScript
- Uses HTML and CSS
- Core features for SPA's are included

#### Cons

- Uses TypeScript, not regular Javascript. So there is a steaper learning curve
- Slower startup because it is heavier
- Losing it's popularity

![Vue](https://github.com/nicplackle/note-app-front-end/img/vue_logo.png "Vue")

### Vue.js

#### Pros

- Mix of React and Angular
- It is a complete framework
- Can be used to build mobile apps with Iconic or NativeScript
- Uses HTML and CSS
- Can be dropped into existing web app/view
- Has good documentation

#### Cons

- Not yet used by a lot of big companies
- Has less packages than Angular

#### Conclusion

I will start this project with React, because it is used the most often in larger companies. Another plus is that it is "just" a library and not a framework. To me it seems logical to start that way and when I grasp the concept move to a framework.
